Archived Pingu website that is 100% fully functional

Pingu's owned by Mattel, HIT Entertainment, and the Pygos Group, and the respectful owners. Flash's owned by Adobe/Macromedia. For users that use browsers that no longer support Flash, try Ruffle! (https://ruffle.rs) For Pale Moon users (and Pale Moon still supports Flash) you're good to go!

I DO ****NOT**** OWN PINGU, FLASH, OR ANYTHING ELSE HERE. THIS PROJECT IS JUST FOR BRINGING BACK DAT NOSTALGIA BABY!!! (and also preservation too!)
